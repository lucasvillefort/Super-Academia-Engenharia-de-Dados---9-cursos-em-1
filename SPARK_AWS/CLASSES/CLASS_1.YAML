        - IAM -> Users -> Add user -> User name -> PROVIDE user access to AWS console 
              -> i want to create an iam user -> custom password -> set permisson 
              -> attach existing policies directly -> AdministratorAccess -> next -> create user -> download .csv -> close.

    1.3) CREATE A BUCKET IN S3:
        - S3 -> Create bucket -> bucket name -> region -> create bucket -> close. # CREATE TWO BUCKETS: ONE FOR INPUT AND ANOTHER FOR OUTPUT.
    
    1.4) CREATE A VPC TO RUN THE EMR:
        # aws vpc is a virtual network that you define in the cloud. it closely resembles a traditional network that you'd operate in your own data center, with the benefits of using the scalable infrastructure of AWS.
        - VPC -> Your VPCs 
              -> Create VPC 
              -> VPC name 
              -> number of availability zones 2
              -> number of public subnets 2
              -> number of private subnets 0
              -> vpc endpoint s3 gateway
              -> nat gateway  none
              -> create VPC.
        
    1.5) CREATE A CLUSTER IN EMR:
        - EMR -> Create cluster 
              -> name -> amazon emr release -> aplication bundle (spark and zeppelin, jupyterEnterprise)
              -> instance type (m5.xlarge) -> remove task -> cluster scaling and provisioning (use EMR managed scaling)
              -> minimun cluster size 3 max size 10 max core 8 max instance 8
              -> provisioning configuration (instance size 2)
              -> networking (brower to vpc created e subnet public)
              -> cluster termination (automatically terminate 1 day)
              -> cluster logs (create a new s3 bucket automaticaly)
              -> amazon ec2 key pair (create a new key pair -> .pem -> download)
              -> create a service role  -> security groups -> choose my vpc create
              -> create an instance prifile -> all s3 buckets in this account with read and write access
              -> create cluster.
